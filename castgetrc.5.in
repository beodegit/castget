.TH CASTGETRC "5" "November 2007" "@PACKAGE_STRING@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
castgetrc \- configuration file for castget
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The configuration file \fB.castgetrc\fR should be located in a user's
home directory. It defines the behaviour of the RSS enclosure
downloader \fBcastget\fR, and in particular the list of channels it
operates on.
.PP
The file is based on a simple key-value format. It consists of a
channel definition for each RSS feed \fBcastget\fR should process. A
channel definition starts with a line containing a channel identifier
enclosed in brackets. The channel identifier can be freely chosen by
the user and is used for all subsequent operations on the
channel. Following this are one or more key-value pairs on the form
\fBkey=value\fR that define \fBcastget\fR's behaviour when operating
on the channel. A channel definition ends when another
channel definition is started or at the end of the file. 
.PP
Lines beginning with a hash character (`#') and blank lines are considered comments. All identifiers, keys and values should be UTF-8 encoded.
.PP
Key-value pairs in a channel definition define the behaviour of \fBcastget\fR when processing the channel. The channel definition
.PP
  [df]
  url=http://digitalflotsam.org/rss.xml
  spool=/home/joe/podcasts
.PP
for example, instructs \fBcastget\fR to use \fB/home/joe/podcasts\fR as a download directory when processing the channel \fBdf\fR.

.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
A channel definition with the channel identifier `*' will define a global configuration affecting all channels. The global configuration
.PP
  [*]
  id3contenttype=Podcast
.PP
for example, is equivalent to adding the key-value pair \fBid3contenttype=Podcast\fR to all other channel definitions.
.PP
Key-value pairs in channel definitions override the global configuration.
.SH CHANNEL REMOVAL
If a channel configuration is removed, the channel status remains the same so that if the channel is subsequently re-added, any enclosures marked as already downloaded will not be downloaded again.
.SH NOTE
The source distribution includes a sample configuration file demonstrating all supported settings.
